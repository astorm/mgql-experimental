Experimental repo -- can I compile/transpile enough of the Magento source to reimplement its CRUD and Service Contract layer in javascript in order to enable a javascript based GraphQL server.  (this is a horrible idea)

Very early days -- current goal is to "hand compile" the classes needed to read a CMS Page out of the database in order to build up a feeling for how closely javascript can emulate PHP's more esoteric features.
